Driftmoon Mod Switcher by Vincent Verhoeven <verhoevenv@gmail.com>.

A simple C# utility to switch between mods in the Driftmoon game. This tool works with the preview version (it might require administrator rights), but it might or might not work with further versions.

GPL v3 licensed.

Driftmoon is a game by Ville Monkkonen, I have no affiliations with Ville other than that I like his games.
